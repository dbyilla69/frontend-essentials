1.  Write a function capitalize that takes a string and
    uses `.map` to return the same string in all caps. Write test to it.

2.  Now write a new function called swapCase that takes a string of words and uses .map and your newly written capitalize()
    function to return a string where every other word is in all caps. Write a test to test the function.
    ```js
    ex: const string = 'hello world'
    will return 'hello WORLD'
    ```
3.  Convert the mock-data set to an object where movieId will be the unique key for each item.
    ```js
    //example outocme
    const moviesById = {
      1: { id: 1, name: '', title: '', time: '', theaterAddress: '' },
      2: { id: 1, name: '', title: '', time: '', theaterAddress: '' }
    };
    ```
